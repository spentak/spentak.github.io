    "content": "Unreal Engine Components Not Showing In Blueprint So this seems really simple when I write it out, but I lost two hours of my life to this. Basically, I was duplicating Blueprints on a health bar UWidgetComponent and I knew I needed to move the logic into C++ for code reduction. I wrote the code, and even got the health bar widget working in the game. The problem was, inside of the Blueprint Editor, my UWidgetComponent was nowhere to be found and I couldn’t edit it. I thought I was going crazy. The problem was I had the widget code inside of BeginPlay instead of the constructor. Don’t do this void AGameCharacter::BeginPlay() { HealthBarWidget = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UWidgetComponent&gt;(this, TEXT(&quot;HealthBarWidget&quot;)); HealthBarWidget-&gt;SetupAttachment(RootComponent); } Instead do this AGameCharacter::AGameCharacter() { HealthBarWidget = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UWidgetComponent&gt;(this, TEXT(&quot;HealthBarWidget&quot;)); HealthBarWidget-&gt;SetupAttachment(RootComponent); } Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",
